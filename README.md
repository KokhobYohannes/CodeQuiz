Objective: To create a ten question coding quiz with four multiple choice answers that will subtract time for incorrect answers and store users' scores for comparison.

Description: The goal for the application is that once the user clicks "Start/Ok" that a timer will begin counting down to zero. For each question answered incorrectly from the ten questions listed, time will be subtracted. Once the user gets to the end of the quiz, they will be able to enter their name along side their score and can restart the game.
